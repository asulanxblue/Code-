        <p>
            Basketball, a fast-paced team sport, captures the hearts of millions globally. Invented by Dr. James Naismith in 1891, it involves two teams aiming to score by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop. Played on indoor and outdoor courts, it demands a blend of athleticism, skill, and strategy. Basketball's popularity has soared, with the NBA becoming a global phenomenon. The game promotes teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship while fostering individual talents like dribbling, passing, and shooting. Iconic players like Michael Jordan and LeBron James have elevated it to a cultural force, inspiring generations. Whether on the playground or the professional stage, basketball's excitement and competitive spirit endure.</p>
